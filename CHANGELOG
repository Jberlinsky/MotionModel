2012-09-05: Basically rewrote how the data is stored.

The API remains consistent, but a certain amount of
efficiency is added by adding hashes to map column names
to the column metadata.

* Type casting now works, and is a function of initialization
  and of assignment.

* Default values have been added to fill in values
  if not specified in new or create.
  
2012-09-06: Added block-style finders. Added delete method.

2012-09-07: IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ! Two new methods were added
            to MotionModel to support persistence:
            
            Task#serialize_to_file(file_name)
            Task.deserialize_from_file(file_name)
            
            Note that serialize operates on an instance and
            deserialize is a class method that creates an
            instance.
