2012-12-07: Added MIT license file.

2012-12-06: Work on has_many to add cascading delete

MotionModel: POTENTIAL CODE-BREAKING CHANGE. has_many now takes two arguments
             only. Previously, it would allow a list of symbols or strings,
             now it conforms more to the Rails way of one call per relation.
             E.g.:

             has_many :pets

             -or-

             has_many :pets, :delete => :destroy  # cascade delete.

2012-10-14: Primary New Feature: Notifications

MotionModel: Added bulk update, which suppresses notifications and added it to delete_all.
MotionModel: Added notifications of type MotionModelDataDidChangeNotification on data change.
MotionModel: Added classification code to save to differentiate between save-new and update
MotionModel: Added notification calls to save and delete


2012-09-05: Basically rewrote how the data is stored.

The API remains consistent, but a certain amount of
efficiency is added by adding hashes to map column names
to the column metadata.

* Type casting now works, and is a function of initialization
  and of assignment.

* Default values have been added to fill in values
  if not specified in new or create.

2012-09-06: Added block-style finders. Added delete method.

2012-09-07: IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ! Two new methods were added
            to MotionModel to support persistence:

            Task#serialize_to_file(file_name)
            Task.deserialize_from_file(file_name)

            Note that serialize operates on an instance and
            deserialize is a class method that creates an
            instance.
